# BIP39-Mnemonics-Generator


  <h1>BIP39 Mnemonic Combinations Generator</h1>

   <p>
        This script generates random combinations of BIP39 words from an input file and writes them to an output file as mnemonics. It's a useful tool for creating mnemonics for cryptocurrency wallets or other applications.

        <li>Adjust the input file path, output file path, and the number of combinations to generate in the script as needed.</li>
        <li>Run the script, and it will generate the specified number ( 5,000,000 ) of random combinations and save them to the output file (e.g., <code>combinations.txt</code>) as mnemonics.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p>Here's an example of how to run the script:</p>
